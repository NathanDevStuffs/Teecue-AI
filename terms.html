    <h1>Terms of Service ("Terms")</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: 2024-05-22 (YYYY-MM-DD)</p>
    <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the Service operated by Teecue AI ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
    <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all users, visitors, and others who access or use the Service.</p>
    <p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.</p>

    <h2>2. User Conduct</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You agree to use the Service for lawful purposes only and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.</li>
        <li>You agree not to engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the functioning of the Service or its servers and networks.</li>
        <li>You agree not to attempt to gain unauthorized access to any part of the Service or its systems.</li>
        <li>You agree not to upload, post, transmit, or otherwise make available any content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Disclaimer of Liability</h2>
    <p>The information and advice provided by the Service are for educational and informational purposes only. They should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of a qualified healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.</p>

    <h2>4. Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is important to us. We do not collect or store any data you type to our AI.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to update or modify these Terms at any time without prior notice. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the revised Terms on this page. Your continued use of the Service after the posting of the updated Terms constitutes your acceptance of the changes.</p>

    <h2>6. Arbitration</h2>
    <p>For any dispute you have with us, you agree to first contact us at 824650@pdsb.net and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that we are not able to resolve a dispute informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein.</p>
    <p>Unless you and we agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, except that we will pay for your reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees, and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property, or unauthorized access to the Service.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us at 824650@pdsb.net.</p>
